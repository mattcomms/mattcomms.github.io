										<h2>Ownership and Commercial Rights of JYD NFTs</h2>

										<p>By minting a Ghoulie NFT from our smart contract, purchasing it off the secondary market (e.g. OpenSea), or otherwise acquiring the Dog through any other legitimate means or method, the Holder receives full and complete ownership, inclusive of commercial rights, to the NFT and the corresponding unique artwork. The License the Holder is receiving is solely for the Licensed NFT Ghoulie which includes the right to use the Licensed NFT Dog and the right to reproduce the Licensed NFT Dog on tribute or derivative art, merchandise, or sharing these rights with third party projects. The Holder agrees not to use, utilize, portray, advertise, distribute or otherwise market any Ghoulie in any project or derivative work that involves hate speech, racism, pornography, or any other illegal or unlawful content. Upon sale or transfer of the NFT, any ownership or commercial rights are immediately transferred to the new Holder. No refunds shall be issued to any Holder upon a full and complete lawful purchase of any NFT or Ghoulie. In the event that any Holder purchases a Ghoulie through the secondary market, such as OpenSea, Holder shall be held accountable and will be bound by the Terms of Service which govern said secondary market platform.
										</p>

										<h2>Art and Creative Design</h2>

										<p>Ghoulies may bear elements of transformative fan art or caricatures which are rendered in good faith to add humor and satire to the project. Any Holder of a Ghoulie bearing these elements has an individual responsibility to determine the appropriateness of subsequent usage. Any Attributes assosiated to a Ghoulie is used as a parody. These attributes are not sponsored, endorsed by or affiliated by any affiliated companies and/or third party licensors.</p>

										<h2>Limitations of Liability for Gas, Failed Transactions, Smart Contract Bugs</h2>

										<p>Participants in minting Ghoulies NFTs agree to hold the project Creative Team harmless for any losses incurred as a consequence of minting an NFT. These potential losses include any gas fees for failed transactions, any excessive gas fees charged due to website or smart contract bugs, and any loss of any NFT due to website or smart contract bugs.</p>

										<h2>No Guarantees or Future Promises</h2>

										<p>While the Ghoulies Creative Team have released a roadmap outlining future goals and plans for community development, we cannot guarantee to accomplish every item outlined during the pre-launch planning phase as ideas and projects evolve organically. You agree that your purchase of a Ghoulie from our initial launch of 8000 NFTs is all you are guaranteed to receive with your initial purchase, whether through primary or secondary channels. Any future benefits are ancillary to this purchase and not to be taken into consideration with your initial purchase. You agree that you are not relying on any future commitments by The Ghoulies Team in using this site and participating in our NFT launch.</p>

										<h2>No Guarantees of Value</h2>

										<p>Underverse NFTs such as Ghoulies were created purely as collectibles, not as investment vehicles or substitutes for cryptocurrency. We make absolutely no promise or guarantee that these NFTs will subsequently retain monetary value in fiat, cash or cryptocurrency.</p>

										<h2>Taxes</h2>

										<p>Each Holder is solely and entirely responsible for any and all Federal or State tax liabilities which may arise, be imposed, or enforced as a result of minting or reselling Ghoulie NFTs.</p>

										<h2>Class Action Waiver, Jurisdiction and Choice of Law</h2>

										<p>You agree to waive any class action status, and any legal dispute around the Ghoulies project which you may choose to bring can only be done on an individual basis.</p>
